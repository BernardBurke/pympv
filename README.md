# pympv


## A Python version of mpv_utils

My edl utilities are for media library management, editing and playing.

The [mpv project](www.mpv.io) has to be one of the best bits of opensource software that I've come across. It's a swiss army knife of digital media. Everything I've ever tried to do with it proved to be possible. You love VLC? Well, try mpv. Sure, if you aren't comfortable at a command line, you might feel a bit lost. But, that is almost universally true, if you want to truly interact in the opensource world, IMO.

Having just rewritten the Windows/LUA version of this, I figure it's time I produced a python version. 

Just as Stephen King advises in [On Writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Writing:_A_Memoir_of_the_Craft), a *re-write* is a disciplin that can drive your content forward in a way that editing will never do.
